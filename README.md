## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES8 JS

### What I learned

This is the first project where I have used two APIs in one project. I learned how to use the [IPGeolocationAPI](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get the IP address locations to populate each field. I also used the latitude or longitude data of the address to generate a map using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)
